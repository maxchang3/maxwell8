# Maxwell8

Yet another TypeScript-based Chip-8 emulator for studying purposes.

- [x] Zero Runtime Dependencies.
- [x] Fully Typed TypeScript.
- [x] Support for quirks like SuperChip and so on.

**WIP ⚠️** This is a work in progress, so expect bugs and missing features. Last few months, I've been working on this project, but I've been busy with other things, so it's been interrupted. In the coming weeks, I plan to dedicate more time to it and refine the project.
