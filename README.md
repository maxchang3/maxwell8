# Maxwell8

Yet another TypeScript-based Chip-8 emulator for studying purposes.

* [x] Zero Runtime Dependencies.
* [x] Fully Typed TypeScript.
* [x] Support for quirks like SuperChip and so on.

**WIP ⚠️** This is a work in progress, so expect bugs and missing features. I've been working on this project for the last few months, but I've been busy with other things, so it's been interrupted. I plan to dedicate more time to it and refine the project in the coming weeks.
